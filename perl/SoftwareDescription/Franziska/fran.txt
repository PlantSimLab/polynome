sample input file

if one wants to provide a probability distribution for function 
stochastic systems, the input files should look like the attachment.
So
f1 = {
    x1+x2         .7
    x1               .3
}

or you can omit them, then I'll use equal probabilities for all functions
f1 = {
    x1+x2    
    x1       
}

Spaces and blanks don't matter.
