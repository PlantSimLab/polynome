1. Deterministic sequential model:
a polynomial dynamical system f = (f_1,\ldots ,f_n): k^n ---> k^n
which is updated sequentially, according to a specified update
order (i_1,\ldots ,i_n). At each update, first variable i_1 is updated,
then variable i_2, using the new value for i_1, etc.

2. Update-stochastic model:
a polynomial dynamical system f = (f_1,\ldots ,f_n): k^n ---> k^n
which is updated sequentially in the following way. At each
update, random delays are introduced on the variables, which result
in variables being updated sequentially in random order.

Several publications have argued that it is biologically more realistic to
use sequential update, since different processes complete at varying times.
If an update order is known, such as for the successive nodes in a
molecular pathway, then a deterministic model results. If stochastic 
features
are taken into account, then the update schedule becomes random and
one obtains an update-stochastic model.

3. Function-stochastic model:
In many instances several possible parameter sets defining functions can be
chosen to obtain a model that fits the given data and input criteria. In 
this
case the user can choose a stochastic consensus model. At each update,
the model uses one of the possible functions chosen at random.

4. Function/update-stochastic model:
This option combines options 2 and 3 by creating a (stochastic) consensus
model with stochastic sequential update.
